# Travel Tracker 

### Abstract
I created an application to manage and track different trips for users and a travel agency. Users are able to login with a username that includes their user id number, and see their dashboard that matches that id. The dashboard displays past trips, total amount spent on trips overall, and total amount spent this year (in 2023). The dashboard also includes a form where users can choose a future date, duration of travel, number of travelers, and the destination, and see the estimated cost of the trip. The submit button will then display all future trips as pending in the upcoming trips section.  

### Technologies Used:

### Learning Goals:
1. Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
1. Work with an API to send and receive data
1. Solidify the code review process
1. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Wins + Challenges:

##### Wins
- Using OOP, including classes/objects and methods
- Appropriately fetching and posting data via GET and POST network requests 
- Using test-driving development (TDD)
- Installing and utilizing a third-party package called moment.js (to format dates)
- Asking for help when needed

##### Challenges
- Resolving promises returned from fetch requests using `Promise.all()` and `.then()`
- Asking help from others 
- Uploading a gif with appropriate size and good quality
